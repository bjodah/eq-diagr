To compile the *.nsi-files:

Create a folder \PortableApps in the root of a hard disk
or USB memory stick. 

Go to https://portableapps.com/apps
and download NSIS Portable
https://portableapps.com/apps/development/nsis_portable

Run the file downloaded
  "NSISPortable_3.03_English.paf.exe"
and 'install' the software on the \PortableApps folder
that you just created.

Run the NSISPortable.exe that you will find in folder
  E:\PortableApps\NSISPortable
and click on "Compile NSI scripts". A window with title
"MakeNSISW" will open.

Drag any nsi-file into this window to compile it and
generate an exe-file.
