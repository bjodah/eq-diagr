Chemical Equilibrium Diagrams
-----------------------------

This software has been developed using Netbeans (v.8.0.2 portable).

Netbeans works with "projects".  Each Netbeans project consists of
a main folder with at least two subfolders: "nbproject" and "src"
(the last one contains the source code).

The top folder of "Chemical Equilibrium Diagrams" is a Netbeans
project named "trunk".  It contains the usual subfolders,
"nbproject" and "src", as well as a number of subfolders, each
with a Netbeans project:
 - AddShowReferences
 - Chem_Diagr_Help
 - DataBase
 - DataMaintenance
 - LibChemDiagr
 - LibDataBase
 - NSIS
 - PlotPDF
 - PlotPS
 - Predom
 - SED
 - Spana
Each of these projects (except NSIS) generate a "compiled"
jar-file when they are opened in Netbeans and "Clean and Build"
is selected.  These jar-files are generated by Netbeans in
subfolder "dist" of the corresponding project folder.

For Chem_Diagr_Help it is convenient to include the help contents
in the jar-file, so that the help system is a single file.  See
file "README_javaHelp.txt" in folder "Chem_Diagr_Help" for details. 

The jar-files created with Netbeans may be managed using Windows
script files (*.cmd), which rely on Microsoft's NMake and on
GnuWin32 tools such as zip, unzip, touch, etc.

The script "!!_Update_lib_versions.cmd" may be used to write the
version date into the two libraries (LibChemDiagr and LibDataBase)
based on the latest modified date for the java-files in each 
of these two libraries.

The project NSIS contains scripts (*.nsi) to generate Windows
exe-files.  "Eq-Diagr_Java_Setup.nsi" generates a windows
installer, and the other nsi-files in folder NSIS\src generate
java-launchers, that is, exe-files that launch java with a jar-file.
The files in subfolder NSIS\src\PortableApps are used to generate
exe-files that launch the portable version of DataBase and Spana.
The NSIS installer, and the java-launchers may be generated with
the scripts "!go_Win-installer.cmd" and "!go_java-launchers.cmd",
respectively.

When all jar-files and exe-files are updated, and eventually
the database has been revised, the files may be moved to a common
folder named "dist" (parallel to the main "trunk" folder).
Three bundles are then generated:
 - Eq-Diagr_Java_Setup.exe (Windows installer)
 - Eq-Diagr_Java.zip (multi platform release)
 - Eq-Diagr_java_Mac-OS.zip (files that may be used under MacOS)

Because the bundle "Eq-Diagr_Java.zip" is intended for Linux (and
Windows or MacOS as well), the script "0modifyZip-file.sh" must be
run on a Linux machine to set the proper file permissions to the
script files contained in this bundle.

After that, these three bundles may be uploaded to GitHub,
SourceForge, Google Drive, etc, as a release.
